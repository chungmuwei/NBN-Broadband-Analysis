In this video, I'll briefly explain my recommendation about the best 
100/40 Mbps family broadband plan in NSW based on thier speed, latency, average outages per day, and price. The data used in the report is published by ACCC in December 2021.

I would recommend choosing Exetel since it strikes a balance between 
performance, reliability, and price. It has over 100 Mbps download speed, resonable upload speed, and less than 10 ms latency in the busy hours. As well as low average outages per day. 

Finally, Exetel is 1 of the 4 RSPs providing 40 Mbps options currently and it also have an affordable price.

For more detail information, please refer to the report. Thank you.
